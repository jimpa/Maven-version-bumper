Thing coming in the near future
===============================

Version bumper has been released as 1.0 and through that process a few short comings has been identified that needs
to be fixed for it to be the tool that the author envisioned it to be.

1 - Feature: The possibility to get warnings about present SNAPSHOT versions in the affected pom-files after update.
  If the aim of an update is to bump all modules to non-SNAPSHOT versions, it is easy to miss one and that will
  lead to that the release contains non fixed versions. The possibility to ask for warnings of this during a
  dry run would be useful.

2 - Feature: External, read-only, modules to use in updates.
  These modules doesn't need a full set of information, only the GAV-coordinates.

3 - Feature: scenarios needs to be restartable and the steps already completed needs to be skipped.
  If during a run of a scenario somethings breaks, it should be easy to just resume the scenario from where it broke.

4 - More version control systems needs to be implemented.
  * Subversion
  * CVS (?)
