Thing coming in the near future
===============================

Version bumper has been released as 1.0 and through that process a few short comings has been identified that needs
to be fixed for it to be the tool that the author envisioned it to be.

1 - Bug: labeling of the base of a multi-module project mixes up what commit gets the label in the sub modules.
  The cause for this is that all VCS is done within the Module instances save method, and since these are not aware
  of each other, labeling can sometimes be performed before all pom.xml-files has been committed.

2 - Feature: scenarios needs to be restartable and the steps already completed needs to be skipped.
  If during a run of a scenario somethings breaks, it should be easy to just resume the scenario from where it broke.

3 - More version control systems needs to be implemented.
  * Subversion
  * CVS (?)
