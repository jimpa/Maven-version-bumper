Thing coming in the near future
===============================

Version bumper has been released as 1.1 and through that process a few short comings has been identified that needs
to be fixed for it to be the tool that the author envisioned it to be.

1 - Feature: scenarios needs to be restartable and the steps already completed needs to be skipped.
  If during a run of a scenario somethings breaks, it should be easy to just resume the scenario from where it broke.

2 - More version control systems needs to be implemented.
  * Subversion
  * CVS (?)

3 - Load VCS via path

4 - Option to do presave and save, but not commit/label for test runs..
